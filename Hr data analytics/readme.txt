📊 HR Analytics Dashboard – Employee Attrition & Insights
A Power BI dashboard project to analyse employee attrition, satisfaction, demographics, and organizational trends using the IBM HR Analytics Dataset.
________________________________________
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to:
•	Explore key HR metrics like attrition, job satisfaction, work-life balance, and more.
•	Analyse department-wise and role-based trends.
•	Identify factors contributing to employee turnover.
•	Build a professional, interactive dashboard in Power BI.

📦 Dataset
Source: IBM HR Analytics Dataset on Kaggle
•	1470 employee records
•	35+ features including:
o	Demographics (Age, Gender, MaritalStatus)
o	Job-related (Department, JobRole, MonthlyIncome)
o	Performance indicators (JobSatisfaction, PerformanceRating)
o	Attrition labels (Yes/No)
